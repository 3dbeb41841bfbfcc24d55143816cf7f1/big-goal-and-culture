# Big Goal and Class Culture (1 hr 30 min)

## Objectives
* Break the ice and help students feel comfortable interacting with instructors and other students.
* Establish expectations for what students will learn and how they will learn.
* Help students and class as a whole *own* their experience and the classroom *culture*.

## Intro (5-10 min)
**Big Goal**: What we want to accomplish. Each day and lesson should tie into the big goal somehow.

**Culture**: How we're gonna get there.

VSEE ==> Vision / Strategy / Execution / Evaluation

## Big Goal (25-30 min)

What we want to accomplish!

### Examples:

* [The Instructor's Big Goal Example](samples/big-goal-instructors.md)
* [ATL 1 Student's Big Goal and Culture](samples/big-goal-students.md)

> Split up the students and have them write on desks or board about what they want to get out of the class. Then make a Big Goal list.

## Class Culture (25-30 min)

Each WDI gets to choose what they want their class culture to be like. Here are some questions to think about and answer:

* How do you want to treat each other?
* How do you want to work together?
* How do you want to be treated by the instructor team?
* How do you want to treat the instructor team?
* What do you want to do about mobiles/facebook?
* What do you want to do if someone misses classes

> Break into groups and discuss what you want your training to be like (10-15 mins)

> Discuss your answers (15mins)

Previous rules for reference can be found [here](samples/culture.md).

## Asking for Help (10 minutes)

What is asking for help?

- This is the thing students find the hardest, and the thing that ultimately determines whether or not students will be successful in this class.
- Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.
- Most importantly, **knowing how to ask for help and where to look for answers** is one of the biggest skills you can gain from this class that will be applicable as you prepare to join the professional workforce.

**Turn & Talk**: Everyone should take 30 seconds to think of a time when they've asked someone for help. It doesn't have to be tech-related. Then take 30 seconds to turn and share with your tablemates about those times. What were the outcomes?

We have all asked for help. There's no shame in it. Feeling afraid to ask for help will be one of the biggest detriments in this class.

* What makes asking for help effective?
  - Asking a clear problem:
    * "I don't know any of this" is *not* a clear problem.
    * "I tried this thing and got this error" *is* a clear problem.
  - We will ask you for help when:
      * The question you're asking isn't clear or constructive
      * It's obvious that you haven't made a sufficient effort to find the answer

### How to Ask for Help

1. First, try it yourself
2. Then, Google it
3. Then, ask another student
4. Finally, ask an instructor
