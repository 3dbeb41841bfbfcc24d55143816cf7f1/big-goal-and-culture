# Culture

## Class Rules:

1. Respect fellow classmates and instructional team.
2. One person talks at a time during teaching time.
3. We expect you to attend all lessons and labs. Please inform the instructional team in advance if you know you will miss a session.
4. Arrive on time. Latecomers really distract the class.
5. No distracting games or videos.
6. Silence mobiles. Absolutely no calls in class.
7. Instructional team will be patient and courteous with students.
8. We should encourage a collaborative environment within the classroom.

## Expectations:

1. You will need to work after hours to keep up with the course work.
2. Take advantage of the instructional team, we are here to support you.
3. Help each other, you will all be experiencing the same problems.
4. Make your mistakes in the classroom, this will help you to develop.
5. Repetition is the key, especially in the first three weeks.
6. Do class exercises, labs, homework. Additional apps on top of this will be an advantage (extra challenges, hack-a-thons, etc).
7. Be vocal about things you do not understand. Chances are you will not be the only person in the same position, we will reiterate until everyone understands.
8. Try and blog or keep a diary of your progress. This will help you understand your own progress.
